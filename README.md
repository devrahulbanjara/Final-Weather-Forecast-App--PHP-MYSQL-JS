The weather application project combines HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL to deliver a dynamic weather experience. It leverages the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data, which is then stored in a MySQL database. Upon user access, the application first checks browser storage for cached data. If not found, it queries the MySQL database. If the data is absent there as well, it fetches it from the API, adds it to the database for future use, and displays it to the user. This robust system ensures that users receive up-to-date weather information efficiently, with data being stored for quicker access in subsequent visits. Overall, this project showcases a comprehensive integration of front-end and back-end technologies to deliver a seamless weather application experience.
